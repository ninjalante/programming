Dice Game - 2 players
This is the digitized version of a simple dice game we've played at bars all over Asia. And now you can play it wherever you want!

What Wedding Movie Should I Watch?
I don't *love* wedding movies, but I sure have seen a lot of them. This Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-esque path figures out what kind of movie you're in the mood for.

Enjoy!
