Bonjour, tout le monde!
These projects represent my latest and greatest achievements in programming.

What Christmas Movie Should I Watch?
I LOVE Christmas movies, and so if you have any preferences, I can recommend the perfect (or not so perfect) watch for you!

Make Your Own Christmas Movie
Maybe you want to write your own! Turn on the TV and see what Hallmark has to offer this year as it randomly generates characters, conflicts, and holiday movie tropes.

Dice Game - 2 players
This is the digitized version of a simple dice game we've played at bars all over Asia. And now you can play it wherever you want!

What Wedding Movie Should I Watch?
I don't *love* wedding movies, but I sure have seen a lot of them. This Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-esque path figures out what kind of movie you're in the mood for.

This project is also available RECURSIVELY, with a tree structure! That code is much more impressive, you should look at that one.

Enjoy!
